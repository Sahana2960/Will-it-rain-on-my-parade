Weather Dashboard & Smart Assistant

Weather Dashboard is a responsive web application that provides a 7-day weather forecast for any city worldwide. Users can select a city by typing it in or by clicking on the interactive map. The app displays detailed weather information, including temperature, chance of rain, and UV levels, along with personalized recommendations for outdoor activities.

Additionally, the app features a Smart Weather Chatbot that can answer natural-language questions such as:

"Should I carry an umbrella today?"

"Is it sunny on Friday?"

"What’s the UV index?"

"What activity can I do today?"

The chatbot intelligently analyzes the forecast data and provides day-specific advice.
